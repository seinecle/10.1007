== What is a board?

A board is a small piece of plastic where electronic components can be added. Which components to add?

It is possible to put an entire small computer (but a small one!) on a board. The exact term for this small computer is a *microcontroller*.

//ST: !

The real size of this object is 8.5cm × 5.6cm (3.3 in × 2.2 in). It costs about 35$.

This picture represents a "Raspberry Pi", where we see the green plastic board, electronic components on it: this is a microcontroller. As a shorthand, we will continue to call this a "board".

== What are boards for?
//ST: What are boards for?
//ST: !

The goal of boards is simple: they can provide the functionalities of a computer in a very small space because they are *tiny*.

//ST: !
For example, if you want to create a connected coffee machine (why not?), it would be weird to attach the coffee machine to this computer:

//ST: !
Instead, we can add a tiny board like the one above, which will do just what we need:
maybe have just a small screen and connecting to our mobile phone via wifi (so that coffee can start when our alarm clock gets off, for instance).

//ST: !
And it will be cheap (just add 35$ to turn your coffee machine into a connected object!) and need just a little bit of electrical current (compared to a big computer).

== Which board to choose?
//ST: Which board to choose?

There are litteraly hundreds of different boards. We choose here the Feather Huzzah:

Why the feather huuzah?

- it is really tiny! 2 in x 0.9 in (51mm x 23mm)
- it can connect to Wifi
- it is cheap: 20$

//ST: !
There are other boards much smaller and cheaper, which can also connect to wifi. Why don't we choose them?

//ST: !
They are much harder to use because:

- they have no plug to branch a standard micro usb cable (remember we need some electricity to power the object!)
- the programming language these boards use are difficult to learn for non specialists.
- their documentation (all the documents explaining how to use them) is very technical, not very clear.


//ST: !
Said differently: the board we are going to use has clear documentation, is easy to plug, and it is easy to program.
Why? Because it is a board following the principles of Arduino: easy to use, even for non specialists.

//ST: !
If you are interested, the whole story is here: it all started with https://arduinohistory.github.io/[a student in design in Italy, in 2003...]
