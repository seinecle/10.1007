==  1. Welcome!


==  !
I am Clement Levallois, Associate Professor at emlyon business school.

Designer and instructor for "IoT for entrepreneurs", code "B4CCO".

==  !
Today we launch the course and give explanations on its objectives and functioning.

==  2. Objectives of the course

==  !
Make you jump on the biz x tech x digital economy

==  !
Can you guess who opened the annual automotive show in Frankfurt this year?

==  !
Sheryl Sandberg, COO at Facebook:

==  !
At the heart of this change, there is the fact that objects get *traversed by data*.

==  !
It's not just mechanics powered by electricity anymore.

It's mechanics, with computers, software (code), Internet connection and data flowing.

==  !
And this is what Internet of Things and smart objects are pretty much about.

==  !
This course is designed to make you *touch* this, feel confident about getting a job in this new economy.

==  3. The way this course works

==  !
==== a. You will build an object

==  !
Displaying the air quality around you.

==  !
You will need to use hardware, software, and see how data flows from the Internet to a tiny object.

==  !
You will need to visit the Makers Lab to solder some pieces.

==  !
==== b. Lectures will be online.

==  !
Brightspace remains your meeting point, especially to read the syllabus and for the assignments.

But there is a link to a full website where the lectures are available.

==  !
So the 3 in-class sessions are devoted to kick-start, follow your progress and close the course.

==  !
Experts video are coming. We are finalizing the filming and they will be put online in October.

==  !
==== c. Assignments are short videos you should make.

==  !
- a video showing the object you created, and explaining the difficulty you faced
- a video showing an object existing on the market, where you discuss its technical, business and security aspects.

==  !
==== More questions?

==  !
- *The syllabus is the definitive document for all your questions*
- I will have office hours on Friday mornings after class.
- You can visit the Makers Lab for soldering and hardware related issues.

==  5. Let's get the objects!

WARNING: they are relatively fragile. Don't leave them at the bottom of your bags. Also, they are not too cheap: 40 euros. Don't loose them.



==  The end
