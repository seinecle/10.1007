At the heart of this change, there is the fact that objects get *traversed by data*.

//ST: !
It's not just mechanics powered by electricity anymore.

It's mechanics, with computers, software (code), Internet connection and data flowing.

//ST: !
And this is what Internet of Things and smart objects are pretty much about.

This course is designed to make you *touch* this, feel confident about getting a job in this new economy.
