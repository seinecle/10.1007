Explanation: your sketch was not loaded to the object yet.

Solution: make sur you got the sketch to load to your object.

You know it has loaded successfully when the red line in the Arduino go to "100%"

==  !
==== "fatal error: Adafruit_SSD1306.h: No such file or directory"
==  "fatal error: Adafruit_SSD1306.h: No such file or directory"

==  !
Solution:

1. install the library from Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries: type SSD1306 in the search bar and find it.


IMPORTANT: In the list of SSD1306 Libraries, make sure you install the one by *Adafruit*, not Acrobotic.

2. Import this lirary in your sketch via Sketch -> Include Libraries -> find it in the list!!

==== "cannot access COM1 / espcomm_open failed"
==  cannot access COM1 / espcomm_open failed

Solution:

==  !
*if you are on a Mac*:

a. New / recent Mac only: make sure you installed this:

https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers

b. Older Mac (Mac OS 10.12.6 or older): make sure you installed this instead:

http://community.silabs.com/t5/Interface-Knowledge-Base/Legacy-OS-Software-and-Driver-Packages/ta-p/182585

c. All Macs: in the Arduino IDE, with your sketch open, go to `Tools` and put your mouse above (don't click!) `Port:`. Then select:

-> In the list of ports, select the one that has "/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART" in the name


*if you are on a PC*:

-> In the list of ports, try selecting each port (COM1, COM17... you might have different ones) until the error disappears.

==== Upload complete but nothing on screen
==  Upload complete but nothing on screen

==  !
*Possible causes:*

==  !
*the wifi ssid is invalid:* the name of the ssid you are using includes spaces or special characters (like: "my super wifi")*

-> Use a wifi ssid and passwords which are simpler (like: "mysuperwifi")

==  !
*If you are on a Mac Computer*, the adaptator for USB cables (white cable on the picture below) does not work:
